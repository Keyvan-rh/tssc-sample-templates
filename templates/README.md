# Templates

The different sub-directories in this directory represent different sample templates. Each must be
referenced in the [all.yaml](/all.yaml) file in order to be available for use.

To experiment with manual changes, copy a template from this directory into `../experimental`.  Add
a reference to the template in [all.yaml](/all.yaml).
